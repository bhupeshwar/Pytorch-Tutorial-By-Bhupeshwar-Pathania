# Pytorch-Tutorial-By-Bhupeshwar-Pathania

PyTorch is defined as an open source machine learning library for Python.
It is used for applications such as natural language processing. 
It is initially developed by Facebook artificial-intelligence research group, and Uberâ€™s Pyro software for probabilistic programming which is built on it.

Originally, PyTorch was developed by Hugh Perkins as a Python wrapper for the LusJIT based on Torch framework. There are two PyTorch variants.

PyTorch redesigns and implements Torch in Python while sharing the same core C libraries for the backend code. 
PyTorch developers tuned this back-end code to run Python efficiently. They also kept the GPU based hardware acceleration as well as the extensibility features that made Lua-based Torch.

# Advantages of PyTorch

1. It is easy to debug and understand the code.
2. It includes many layers as Torch.
3. It includes lot of loss functions.
4. It can be considered as NumPy extension to GPUs.
5. It allows building networks whose structure is dependent on computation itself.

# Prerequisite

PyTorch is completely based on Python. So, it is essential to have basic knowledge of Python to implement the PyTorch project. 
Good understanding of basic mathematics allows us to understand the concept of PyTorch better.
